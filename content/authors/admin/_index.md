I am a masters student at the University of British Columbia. My thesis was on novel catalytic dehydrogenation processes for propylene production, and now I'm working on a transdisciplinary decarbonization project before I graduate in May 2024. I completed my BASc at UBC as well - they just can't get rid of me! During my undergrad I majored in chemical process engineering and minored in analytical chemistry. In both cases I was particularly interested by systems modeling and the human side of engineering - both things that have heavily guide my research. In my free time I enjoy skiing, gardening, and taking on small projects, like building a chess bot or setting up small-scale vertical farms in my basement.

Winner of the APSC Design and Innovation Day Award for my capstone project on the design and simulation of a novel Sabatier process sponsored by FortisBC, former AICHE regional chapter executive, former ChemE Car team lead and UBC Envision safety officer. Current lead with UBC Agroponics.
