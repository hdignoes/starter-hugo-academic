The Sabatier process is a much-studied process that has almost never been implemented. The most notable example of its application is in the International Space Station's Environmental Control and Life Support System, where it serves to remove CO2 released by astronauts and make methane fuel and water. The reaction is fairly simple and is really just steam reformation, except it's backwards. The reaction is as follows:

CO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub> &#8594 CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 165kJ

The question that our sponsor, FortisBC, had was why has nobody done this at large scale? Is it because it only works at high pressure, and the carbon price of compression outweighed that of the carbon converted? Does it just have bad yields? Maybe it requires highly specific and expensive catalysts... My team and I spent the better part of a year going through literature and building models and simulations to find the answers and have the data to back them up. If you can't wait until the end, the answers are "I guess they just missed it.", "Not if you're using hydro power, like we do in BC!", "Nope, conversion to methane can be upards of 99%", and "Some people like ruthenium or molybdenum catalysts, but it actually works great with regular ol' nickel on alumina".
